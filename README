This is a simple implementation of Score4 (also called Connect4).
The goal is to form horizontal, vertical or diagonal series of
4 of your chips (green). The computer tries to do the same, using
red chips.

The GNU-licensed code includes F#, OCaml, C# and C++ implementations, 
using both functional and imperative styles of coding, with ports 
coming in from all over the Web to many more languages.

Precompiled windows binary of the game is under:
